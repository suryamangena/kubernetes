# kubernetes
Kubernetes addresses the management challenges of containers. It is orchestrator of microservices apps.

## Cluster
Cluster is made up of one or more masters and bunch of nodes. 

## Master
1) Software runs in master called as Control plane
2) Never deploy application without having multi-master H/A control plane 
3) Masters are suggested to have in cluster
4) If has any trouble, 5 masters are suggested
5) For example, 3 masters, in this 1 will be leader and other will be followers, if leader goes down other followers come together to elect new leader among them
6) [Run business apps in nodes and leave masters for control plane operations](images/master-business-app.png)

## Nodes
Nodes do the work 

## Pods
K8 needs cotainer to be wrapped in pods. Scaling and self healing needs pods wraped inside the deployment.

## [Architecture](images/K8-architecture.png)

## Kube-apiserver
    - Frontend to the control panel 
    - Exposes the API(REST)
    - Consumes JSON/YAML

## Cluser Store
    -Persists cluster state and config
    -Based on etcd no sql database
    -Performance is critical

## Kube controller manager
    -Controller of Controllers
        a) Node Controller
        b) Deployment Controller
        c) Endpoints/EndpointSlice controller
    -Watch loops
    - Reconciles(match) observed state with desired state

## Kube-scheduler
    -Watches API server for new work tasks
    -Assign work to cluser nodes
Note: [Refer to sanpshot](images/scheduler-controller.png)

## [Kubelet](images/kubelet.png)
    - Main kubernetes agent that run on every node 
    - Registers node with cluster, watches api server on the master for the new work assignments
    - Report back to master and maintain state of clusters and running apps
    - kubelet don't how to run containers

## [Container runtime](images/container-runtime.png)
    -Can be Docker
    -Pluggable: Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
        - Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Kata

## [Kube-proxy](images/kube-proxy.png)
    -Networking Component
    -Pod IP Address-> it assign unique ip address to the pod 
    -If pod has multicontainers all the containers will get single ip and if we want to reach each individual containers. Proxy use light weight load balancer to manage

## Virtual Kubelet
    -No nodes
    -Pods run on cloud's hosted container backend

## [Declarative Model & Desired State](images/state.png)
    -Describe the end/desire state in a manifest file. Manifest file is a description what it has to look like and it is not a long list of commands to achieve desire state.
     Long list of commands is called as imperative method
    -Post that manifest file to the apiserver in master and its upto kubernetes to do whatever it is necessary to get end state

## Pods
1) Kubernetes can only runs containers within pods, containers without pods are not eligible to run in kubernetes
2) [Pod is a shared execution envrionment (network, memory, volume )](images/pods-loosely-tightly.png)
3) [Never scale by adding more containers to a single mod, instead add more pods for scaling](images/pods-scaling.png)
4) Pods deployment are unatomic operation, it is all or nothing job (mean pod only shows up and running and available for service once all the containers in pod up and running). It is never available and stop accepting connections, when some of the containers in pod are not ready and up 
5) Containers in pod always scheduled to same node 
6) Pods are mortal, they live and die
7) Pods have Annotations, Label, Policies, Resources, Co-scheduling containers
8) Pods can't scale or heal

## Service Mesh
1) It injects Mesh container into existing pod where App container is there, it encrypts/decrypts traffic coming to pod or out of pod

## Atomic Operations
Atomic operations in concurrent programming are program operations that run completely independently of any other processes. Atomic operations are used in many modern operating systems and parallel processing systems

## Stable Networking with Kubernetes Services
1) [Service Object is a kubernetes api object, once it is created, it provides stable name and ip and it nevers change](images/service-object.png)
2) Service Object forward traffice to pods via labels
3) Only sends traffice to healthy pods
4) Can do session affinity 
5) Can send traffice to endpoints outside the cluster
6) Can do TCP and UDP
